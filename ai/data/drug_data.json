Calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate react with stomach acid, releasing bubbles of carbon dioxide. These bubbles allow the gel to form a strong protective barrier on top of the stomach contents, thereby preventing stomach acid from flowing back into the esophagus. Additionally, sodium bicarbonate dissolves quickly and neutralizes the stomach acid, exerting a rapid buffering action. Sodium alginate reacts with gastric acid present in the stomach and produces a low-density viscous gel that floats on top of the stomach. This forms a physical barrier that protects the esophageal mucosa and the airways from the gastric reflux. Alginate has a rapid onset, providing quick relief from reflux symptoms. Additionally, it has a prolonged duration of action, providing relief for up to 4 hours.",
